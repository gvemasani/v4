A causal analysis to determine the impact of Airbnb's Superhost status on occupancy rates. By utilizing a difference-in-differences approach, the study compares occupancy changes between properties that just missed and just achieved Superhost status over several evaluation periods. Data manipulation and analysis are performed using Python, employing regression techniques to isolate the effect of Superhost certification on occupancy. The results aim to quantify how this status influences guest booking behaviors on Airbnb.
